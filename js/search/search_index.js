structures.\n\nThis project and the accompanying bachelor's thesis were inspired by the research group Theoretical Computer Science / Formal Methods by the University of Kassel.\nThe parsing and validation logic of the backend is built upon a Java desktop application by Arno Ehle and Benedikt Hruschka.\n\nNote: This project is also known as gramoFO.\n\nFeatures\n\n🛠 Graph Editor: Interactive graph editor with support for touch controls\n✨ Model Checking: First-order-logic model checking in graph structures\n💹 Feedback: Three different feedback levels provide insight on model-checking results\n☑️ Assignments: Various assignments, which build an understanding for first-order logic and model checking\n🔒 Import/Export: Graphs can be saved locally as wells as exported and imported as JSON and YAML\n📱/💻 Responsive: Optimized for screens of all sizes\n📶 PWA: Apollo is installable and supports offline editing of graphs\n🌐 Localization: Fully localized in English and German\n🌗 Themes: Dark and light designs\n\nLinks\n\nApollo\nApollo-Backend\nApollo-Admin\nDocumentation\nBachelor's thesis (German)\n\nDevelopment\nInstallation\nRun yarn install to install the required dependencies.\nDevelopment server\nRun yarn start to run a development server. The app will open and automatically reload if any source files are changed.\n\nNote: Default port is 4200.\n\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng g c components/{{component-name}} --module=app to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module. To create components with special names such as Page add --type={{type}}.\nLinting & formatting\nRun yarn lint to lint and yarn pretty to format all source files.\nBuild\nRun yarn build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning tests\nRun yarn test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nDeployment\nDocumentation\nRun yarn compodoc to generate the documentation. It will be stored in the documentation/ directory.\nDocker\nRun docker-compose up -d --build to build and start a container. Alternatively, build the image via the Dockerfile.\n\nNote: Default port is 80.\n\n\nNote: Change the argument BACKEND_URL as required.\n\nLicense\nBSD 3-Clause License - Copyright © Jan Müller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nBSD 3-Clause License\nCopyright (c) 2021, Jan Müller\nAll rights reserved.\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\nRedistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\nlist of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\nRedistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\nthis list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\nand/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nNeither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its\ncontributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\nthis software without specific prior written permission.\n\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
